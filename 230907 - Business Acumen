The website https://www.chris-elgood.com/business-acumen-definition/ is a blog post by Chris Elgood, the founder of Elgood Effective Learning, 
a company that provides business simulation games and training courses.

In the post, Elgood defines business acumen as "the ability to take a 'big picture' view of a situation, to weigh it up quickly, make a logical, 
sound decision confidently, and influence others to agree with you in order to have a positive impact towards achieving the objectives of the organisation."

He goes on to say that business acumen is a learned skill, not an innate ability. However, some people are more naturally inclined to develop business acumen than others. T
hose who are curious about the world around them and who are good at understanding how different factors impact each other are more likely to be successful in developing 
business acumen.

Elgood also believes that business acumen is essential for anyone who wants to be successful in business. He says that "over 65 percent of surveyed leaders agreed that 
insufficient business acumen limits their organisation's ability to realise strategic goals to a strong extent."

The website also provides information on how to develop business acumen, including through business simulation games, training courses, and mentoring.

Overall, the website is a good resource for anyone who wants to learn more about business acumen and how to develop it.
