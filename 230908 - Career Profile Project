Subject: Updating Career Profile

I've updated my career profile on LinkedIn and started by reviewing my current profile. Plus, identifying areas that could be improved. 

here are the following changes:
Updated my headline to reflect my current job title and the type of roles I am interested in. Also, added a summary statement that highlights my skills and experience.
Updated my work experience section to include my most recent job and any relevant volunteer or freelance work together with skills section that lists my hard skills 
(e.g., proficiency in Microsoft Office) and soft skills (e.g., communication, teamwork).
I've added a volunteer experience section to highlight any relevant volunteer work I have done, publications section to list any relevant publications I have authored &
took the time to proofread my profile carefully and make sure that there were no errors. I am confident that my updated profile will help me to stand out to potential 
employers and land my dream job.

Action Plan
Updating career profile on a regular basis as I gain new skills and experience and will also use my profile to network with other professionals in my field and to
stay up-to-date on the latest technology.
